# Spaceship Titanic
This repository is the holding place of all data and subsequent trained models from a publicly available Kaggle competition [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/overview). The ML algorithms used will be classification based.

*These notebooks have been developed for Project 2 of COMP-4730 (Advanced AI Concepts I) at the University of Windsor, Fall 2023.*

# How To Run
**These instructions assume Python and Jupyter have both been properly installed!**

When attempting to run any Jupyter Notebook file, first ensure that the appropriate libraries have been installed. This can be done by running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will automatically install all Python libraries listed within the `requirements.txt` file. 

The algorithms run off of the training and testing data available under the data folder.
